DERIVED FIELDS
 - There are two kinds of derived fields:
  -Directly Derived Fields - These work directly with one or more netCDF
   fields in the source data to generate the destination field.
  -Indirectly Derived Fields - These work with the intermediate data.

  Directly Derived Fields
    - Are produced in the netCDF files (i.e. step 1)
    - Generating function is specified in params using the fully qualified
      function name (e.g. foo.bar.baz to use function baz from module foo.bar).
      Of course, 'foo' must be in the PYTHONPATH.

  Indirectly derived fields
    - Are produced from the nps_int files, so no netCDF data for them
        -> So if you have  acomplex 3rd-party tool to generate the field from,
           this may be the better choice
        -> But are harder to diagnose since there aren't many options for visuzlizing
           this data


* NOTE that transformation of data to the units expected by NPS is performed
  when converting to the intermediate format, so the netCDF files (i.e. step 1)
  may not be of the expected units
